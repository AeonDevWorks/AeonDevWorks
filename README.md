- 👋 Hi, I’m @AeonDevWorks
- 👀 I’m interested in creating applications powered by AI/ML that empower people to be more productive, creative, smarter, and intrinsically balanced human beings. 
- 🌱 I’m learning and applying AI/ML at the application layer. I'm learning AI/ML right from the first principles and taking possible cues from all paths of human knowledge. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing Agent frameworks and workflows that exhibit higher-order reasoning and self-healing independently, as well as co-reason along with a human user.
- 📫 How to reach me: X - @AvinashAeon

- ⚡ Fun fact: I was lost, but now I'm found. And, never shy away from an honest attempt.
